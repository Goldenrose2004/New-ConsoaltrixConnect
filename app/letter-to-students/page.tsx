                These student guidelines are expressions of the concern your educators have for the continuous 
                development of your personality. They are meant to help you strengthen your character through 
                responsible and self-disciplined life and guarantee a school atmosphere of order, cooperation and 
                peace, which are necessary for your moral and intellectual formation. By your enrollment in Consolatrix 
                College, you express willingness to abide by its rules and regulations. We exhort you, therefore, to read 
                them carefully, to understand them and to put them into practice at all times so that harmony may 
                exist among all in the school.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify text-xs sm:text-base" style={{ fontFamily: "'Inter', sans-serif" }}>
                These guidelines are likewise expressions of the beautiful family Spirit, the life-blood of every 
                Augustinian Recollect School. Accept them therefore as coming from the hearts of your educators who 
                love you. Look to and follow the Blessed Virgin Mary, who lived a life of obedience to the Father's will, 
                diligently teaching her Son how to become a good Son of God in her lowly home at Nazareth. Under her 
                mantle of protection, we are all her children. She wants us to become faithful followers of her Son Jesus, 
                to be honest and productive citizens of our country.
              </p>
